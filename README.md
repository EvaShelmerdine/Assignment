# Assignment
This is my assignment for the module "Reproducible Data Science" at the University of Manchester as part of my MSci in Developmental Biology.
This assignment involved answering 4 questions in order to analyse a data set relating to reaction times to common and rare words.
Please note: I completed this module in the 2019/20 academic year so any future students reading this, this assignment will not be the same as your assignment so do not attempt to copy it!
